to get to the point where you can work for your whole life
honey  begins w hen our valiant pollen jocks bring the nectar tot the hive
our top-secret formula
is automatically color corrected scent adjusted and bubble  contoured
into this soothing sweet syrup
with its distinctive  golden glow you know as 
honey!
that girl was hot
she's my  cousin!
she  is?
yes,  we're all cousins.
right. you're right.
at honex, we constantly strive
to improve every aspect of bee existence
these bees are stress testing
a new helmet  technology
what do you think he makes?
not enough
here we have our  latest advancement the krelman
what does that do?
catches that little strand of honey
that hangs after you pour it. s aves us millions
can anyone work on the krelman?
of course. most bee jobs  are small  ones
but bees know
that every small job, if it's done well, means a  lot.
but choose  carefully
because  you'll s tay in the job  you  pick for t he rest of your life
the same j ob the rest of yourlife?
the samejob the rest  of your life?
i didn't know that
what's the difference
you'll be happy to know that bees
as a  species have haven't had one day  off
in 27 million years
so you'll just work us to death
we'll sure  try
wow! that blew my mind!
"what's the difference?"
how can you say that?
one job forever?
That's an  insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now weo nly  have  to make one decision  in life.
But Adam how could they never have told us that?
Why would you  question anything?
We're bees.__init__We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
Like what? give me one example.
I don't  know but you know w hat I'm talking about
Please clear the gate. Royal Nectar Force on approach
Wait a second. Check it out.
Hey, those a re  Pollen Jocks!
Wow.
I've never seen them this close.
They  know what it's like  outside the hive.
Yeah, but some don't come  back
Hey, Jocks!
Hi,  Jocks!
You guys did great!
You're  monsters!
You're sky freaks!  I l ove it! I love it!
I wonder where they were
I don't know
Their day's not planned
Outside the hive, flying who knows  where, doing who knows what
You can't just decide to be a pollen  jock.  You  have to be bred for that
Right.
Look That's more pollen that you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol. Bees  make toomuch of it.
Perhaps Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you  wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys
Let;s have fun  with them
It must be  dangerous being a Pollen Jock
Yeah. Once a  bear pinned me against a mushroom!
He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
Oh my!
I never thought I'd knock him out.
What were you doing during this?
Trying to alert he authorities.
I can autograph that.

Yeah. Gusty.

Six miles, huh?

A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
Maybe I am.
You are not!
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.
What do you think, buzzy-boy?
Are you bee enough?
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.
Hey, Honex!

You decide what you're interested in?
Well, there's a. lot of choices.
But you only get one.
Doo you ever gete bored doing the samej ob every day?
Son, oet. me t elly ou about stirring.
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.
You get yourself into a. rhythm.
It'sa beautiful thing.
Maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?
That's a bad job for a guywith a. stinger.
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!
Barry, youa re so funny sometimes.
I'm not. trying to be funny.
You're not funny!
You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!
You're going to be a stirrer?
No one's listening to me!
Wait till you see the sticks I have.
I could say anything right now.
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!
Let's open some honey and celebrate!
Maybe I'll piere my throat.
Shave my antennae.
Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody "dawg"!
