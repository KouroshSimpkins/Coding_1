that hangs after you pour it. s aves us millions
can anyone work on the krelman?
of course. most bee jobs  are small  ones
but bees know
that every small job, if it's done well, means a  lot.
but choose  carefully
because  you'll s tay in the job  you  pick for t he rest of your life

That's an  insane choice to have to make.
I'm relieved. Now weo nly  have  to make one decision  in life.
But Adam how could they never have told us that?
Why would you  question anything?

Their day's not planned
Outside the hive, flying who knows  where, doing who knows what
You can't just decide to be a pollen  jock.  You  have to be bred for that
Right.
Look That's more pollen that you and I will see in a lifetime.
It's just a status symbol. Bees  make toomuch of it.
Perhaps Unless you're wearing it
and the ladies see you  wearing it.
Those ladies?
Aren't they our cousins too?
Distant. Distant.
Look at these two.
Couple of Hive Harrys
