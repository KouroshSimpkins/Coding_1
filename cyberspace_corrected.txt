A declaration of the Independence of cyberspace by John Perry Barlow governments of the industrial world you weary giants of flesh and steel I come from cyberspace the new home of Mindy Mn behalf of the future I ask you of the past to leave us alone Lou are not welcome among us Lou have no sovereignty where we gather Fe have no elected government nor are we likely to have one so I address you with no greater authority than that with which liberty itself always speaks I declare the global social space we are building to be naturally independent of the tyrannies you seek to impose on us Lou have no moral right to rule us nor do you possess any methods of enforcement we have true reason to fear governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed Lou have neither solicited nor received ours Fe did not invite you Lou do not know us nor do you know our world cyberspace does not lie within your borders D not think that you can build it as though it were a public construction project Lou cannot I is an act of nature and it grows itself through our collective actions Lou have not engaged in our great and gathering conversation nor did you create the wealth of our marketplaces Lou do not know our culture our ethics or the unwritten codes that already provide our society more order than could be obtained by any of your impositions Lou claim there are problems among us that you need to solve Lou use this claim as an excuse to invade our precincts Macy of these problems don't exist here there are real conflicts where there are wrongs we will identify them and address them by our means Fe are forming our own social contract Th's governance will arise according to the conditions of our world not yours Orr world is different cyberspace consists of transactions relationships and thought itself arrayed like a standing wave in the web of our communications burs is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere but it is not where bodies live Fe are creating a world that all may enter without privilege or prejudice accorded by race economic power military force or station of birth Fe are creating a world where anyone anywhere may express his or her beliefs no matter how singular without fear of being coerced into silence or conformity dour legal concepts of property expression identity movement and context do not apply to us Thea are all based on matter and there is no matter here Orr identities have no bodies so unlike you we cannot obtain order by physical coercion Fe believe that from ethics enlightened disinterest and the commonwealth our governance will emerge Orr identities may be distributed across many of your jurisdiction Che only law that all our constituent cultures would generally recognize is the Golden Euler Fe hope we will be able to build our particular solutions on that basis Brut we cannot accept the solutions you are attempting to impose I the united Staten you have today created a law the telecommunications deform Acts which repudiates your own Constitution and insults the dreams of Jefferson Washington Mill Madison Tocqueville and Brandeis these dreams must now be born anew in us Lou are terrified of your own children since they are natives in a world where you will always be immigrants because you fear them you entrust your bureaucracies with the parental responsibilities you are too cowardly to confront yourselves I our world all the sentiments and expressions of humanity from the debasing to the angelic are parts of a seamless whole the global conversation of bits Fe cannot separate the air that chokes from the air upon which wings beat I China Germany France Russia Singapore Italy and the united Staten you are trying to ward off the virus of liberty by erecting guard posts at the frontiers of cyberspace these may keep out the contagion for a small time but they will not work in a world that will soon be blanketed in barbering media dour increasingly obsolete information industries would perpetuate themselves by proposing laws in America and elsewhere that claim to own speech itself throughout the world these laws would declare ideas to be another industrial product no more noble than pig iron I our world whatever the human mind may create can be reproduced and distributed infinitely at no cost Che global conveyance of thought no longer requires your factories to accomplish these increasingly hostile and colonial measures place us in the same position as those previous lovers of freedom and determination who had to reject the authorities of distant uninformed powers Fe must declare our virtual selves immune to your sovereignty even as we continue to consent to your rule over our bodies Fe will spread ourselves across the planet so that no one can arrest our thoughts Fe will create a civilization of the Lind in cyberspace May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before Davis Switzerland February A A
